TOP Rock Paper Scissors assignment

The goal here was to create a simple rock paper scissors game in the javascript console. I started by getting the computers guess by creating a random number and assigning a guess to the number generated.

Then I created a prompt to take the players guess. If the player does not enter a valid answer it prompts them to enter a valid guess. 

I then had to create a function to compare the answers and create a win state. Which would then add a point to the respective winners score. 

Finally I created a while loop to check the score value, until the one of the scores equal 5, the game will continue to loop. Once one player has 5 points an alert pops up declaring the winner and giving the player the option to play again.
